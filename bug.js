This bug occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions on Android.  The issue is that `Dimensions.get('window')` might return inaccurate values, particularly the height, after the keyboard appears and then disappears.  The height might remain smaller than the actual screen height, even after the keyboard is hidden.

```javascript
// In a component
import {Dimensions, Keyboard} from 'react-native';

const {height} = Dimensions.get('window');

Keyboard.addListener('keyboardDidHide', () => {
  // height is still wrong here!
  console.log('Height after keyboard hide:', height); 
});
```
